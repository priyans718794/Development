        <p>Books are published and released everyday from incredible writers all around the world. But there is nothing like the wit and sophistication of Nepali literature. Back home, we agree on this and read books on the daily. But when you are living abroad, it is tedious to find a book shop that sells Nepali books. Even if you manage to find one, there just aren’t that many to buy and read.Nepali literature and authors still haven’t got the exposure in the international market that they deserve. And you are probably aware of this in Japan too.At Priyans Books , we have thousands and thousands of Nepali books to choose from and we deliver them internationally; including straight to your doorstep in Japan.</p>

        <p>When you live in the land of the royals and the sophisticated, it doesn’t take much to lose yourself in the hustle and bustle abroad. So, what better way to get a taste of home and our roots than reading books by our own authors?Easier said than done, because it is so difficult to find Nepali books in the UK. Even giant shopping sites do not seem to have a good enough collection to browse and pick from. These handful of books are probably everything you’ve already read. Are you looking for more; newer or lesser known books from Nepali authors? If so, you have come to just the right place.  At Priyans Books, we have more titles and authors to browse and pick from than anywhere else. And because we ship and deliver books all over the world, you should definitely not hesitate to buy books from us and have it delivered to your doorstep in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <p>In Nepal, we love to read books and support our authors and literary community as much as possible. But, nepali literature and authors still haven’t got the exposure in the international market that they deserve. If you live in Australia you are well aware of the tender situation there. Finding Nepali books there is not an easy job. You scour to find an international book shop for a long time, and when you do find one, the books are either translated to English or there are books that you have already probably read. All in all, there are not many options for you to browse through and pick as you would have back home in Nepal. However, it is not impossible to buy Nepali books while living abroad, as we have your back. You can buy Nepali books from Australia through Priyans Books.</p>

        <p>If you love reading books, you probably know how expensive books can be. Especially if you are a student with no steady flow of income, it can be difficult to cut down on the little pocket money that you have to buy books. Although it is worth it, it is not always possible.You are lucky if you live in urban areas where there are libraries you can visit to save money and read tons of books at the same time. But anywhere else, it’s not easy to even find a library. And while bookstores have a larger selection of books and are a little easier to find, books are still expensive.  If you are an avid reader, you have probably scoured the internet looking for cheaper alternatives to find books in Nepal. And you most likely came across Priyans Books .  </p>
